# Gradient Descent-Based Optimization Method of a Four-Bar Mechanism Using Fully Cartesian Coordinates

- ShF: Shaking Force equations
- ShM: Shaking Moment equations

A simplified version of **Projected Gradient Descent** is used to minimize
the ShF and ShM functions with the aim of balancing the system.
