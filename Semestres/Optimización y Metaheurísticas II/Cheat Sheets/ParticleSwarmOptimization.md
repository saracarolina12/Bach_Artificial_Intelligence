# üê¶ Particle Swarm Optimization

_by Kennedy and Eberhart 1995_

## **Characteristics**
‚Ä¢ Inspired by the movement of a flock of birds when searching for food.


## **Representation**
Represented by a vector where each element (particle) acts for a solution of the problem. 

In the time $t$, each particle has the position $x^i(t) \in \reals^d$ and a velocity $v^i\in\reals^d$.
