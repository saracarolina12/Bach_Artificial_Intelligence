## **Background**
Ants are insects that prefer community survival rather than as individual species.

They communicate with each other through sounds, touch and pheromone.


Pheromones are organic chemical compounds secreted by the ants so that members of their same species smell it and know where other ants have been. This is how ants think smartly so they gradually improve their food search

## **Selecting the next node**

where $N_i$ represents all the nodes where the ant can move in the next steps (not visited nodes).

$\alpha$ and $\beta$ control the importance of the pheromone vs the heuristic information.
