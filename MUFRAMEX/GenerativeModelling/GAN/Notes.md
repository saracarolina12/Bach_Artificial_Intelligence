# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
_Dennis G. Wilson_
Binary Classification (real or not)


## Generator
noise -> Neural Network -> gen image

## Discriminator


## Problem of GAN
Since we are solving this problem returning a binary decision (real or fake).

## Determining the number of layers
