# Ontologies for describing data
_Nathalie Hernández_

## **What are ontologies?**
Ontology: A set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them.

Data surrounds the world. 

- Human interpretation
- Interpretation by machines.

For example a csv file about weather in France

</p>

- Understand the data.
- Could machines automatically understand th nature of this data?
- How easy is it to link the data in this file with another city data source?


## **What are ontologies for?**
Associate a common unedrstanding to data descriptions


## **Levels of "understanding"**

- __Data:__ Raw element of a reality
- __Information:__ Data and its context. (what our data refers to)
- __Knowledge:__ Background rules enabling deduction on collected information.

## **Logic**

Logic models formalize common sense and reasoning mechanisms in order to study and automatize them.

##  **Vocabularies for describing/annotating data**
    How can I describe my professional Web page?
- Ontologies define useful vocabularies to describe resources.

- Ontologies are Web resources.


## **What do we have in an ontology**
- Labels (terms or symbols) in different languages: fog, nieba, pluie
- Classes (notions, set of objects, event, state,...): Sensor, Location, City, Observation.
-Relations between classes:
    
    - Hierarchy of classes: city is a location
    - Properties: Sensor observes parameter

-More axioms: A sensor that observes a Temperature is a Temperature Sensor.

## **IRI Intenationalized Resource Identifier**
- Unique indentification of resources on the Web.
- Evolution of the notion of URL for internationalization.


## **RDF**
Model based on triples.

(subject, predicate, object)

## **SPARQL: triple patterns**
- Similar to SQL
- Turtle syntax with "?" or "$" to mark _variables_

## **Conclusion**
- Ontologies help making data reusable
- Ontologies help making some information explicit
- Semantic weh technologies can mature and widely used.
- Ontologies are a great solution to provide quality data for machine learning approaches.
